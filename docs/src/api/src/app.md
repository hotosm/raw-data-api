Classes
-------

### Database

```python3
class Database(
    db_params
)
```

Database class is used to connect with your database , run query  and get result from it . It has all tests and validation inside class

#### Methods

    
#### close_conn

```python3
def close_conn(
    self
)
```
function for clossing connection to avoid memory leaks

    
#### connect

```python3
def connect(
    self
)
```
Database class instance method used to connect to database parameters with error printing

    
#### executequery

```python3
def executequery(
    self,
    query
)
```
Function to execute query after connection

### ProgressPercentage

```python3
class ProgressPercentage(
    filename
)
```

Determines the project percentage of aws s3 upload file call

Args:
    object (_type_): _description_

### RawData

```python3
class RawData(
    parameters=None,
    dbdict=None
)
```

Class responsible for the Rawdata Extraction from available sources,
    Currently Works for Underpass source Current Snapshot
Returns:
Geojson Zip file
Supports:
-Any Key value pair of osm tags
-A Polygon
-Osm element type (Optional)

#### Static methods

    
#### close_con

```python3
def close_con(
    con
)
```
Closes connection if exists

    
#### get_grid_id

```python3
def get_grid_id(
    geom,
    cur,
    country_export=False
)
```
Gets the intersecting related grid id for the geometry that is passed

Args:
    geom (_type_): _description_
    cur (_type_): _description_

Returns:
    _type_: grid id , geometry dump and the area of geometry

    
#### ogr_export

```python3
def ogr_export(
    query,
    outputtype,
    working_dir,
    dump_temp_path,
    params
)
```
Function written to support ogr type extractions as well. In this way, we will be able to support all file formats supported by ogr. Currently, it is slow when dataset gets bigger as compared to our own conversion method but rich in feature and data types even though it is slow

    
#### ogr_export_shp

```python3
def ogr_export_shp(
    point_query,
    line_query,
    poly_query,
    working_dir,
    file_name
)
```
Function written to support ogr type extractions as well. In this way, we will be able to support all file formats supported by ogr. Currently, it is slow when dataset gets bigger as compared to our own conversion method but rich in feature and data types even though it is slow

    
#### query2geojson

```python3
def query2geojson(
    con,
    extraction_query,
    dump_temp_file_path
)
```
Function written from scratch without being dependent on any library, provides better performance for geojson binding

    
#### to_geojson_raw

```python3
def to_geojson_raw(
    results
)
```
Responsible for geojson writing

#### Methods

    
#### check_status

```python3
def check_status(
    self
)
```

#### extract_current_data

```python3
def extract_current_data(
    self,
    exportname
)
```
Responsible for Extracting rawdata current snapshot, Initially it creates a geojson file, Generates query, run it with 1000 chunk size and writes it directly to the geojson file and closes the file after dump
Args:
    exportname: takes filename as argument to create geojson file passed from routers

Returns:
    geom_area: area of polygon supplied
    working_dir: dir where results are saved
